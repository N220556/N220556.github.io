# ðŸ‘‰ SSH Connections

# What is SSH
SSH (Secure Shell) is a network protocol that allows you to securely access and manage devices (like servers, routers, or computers) over an unsecured network (like the internet).
- It provides encrypted communication, so data like usernames, passwords, and commands cannot be easily intercepted.

## Why do we use SSH
We use SSH mainly for:
1. **Remote** Login
 â†’ Access a remote computer/server securely.
1. **Remote Command Execution** â†’ Run commands on another machine without being physically there.
1. **File Transfer** â†’ Securely copy files using SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) or SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol).
1. **Tunneling / Port Forwarding** â†’ Securely forward network traffic (e.g., database connection through SSH tunnel).
1. **Key-based Authentication â†’ Authenticate** with keys instead of passwords for more security.

## Syntax of SSH
- basic syntax
```bash 
   ssh [options] username@hostname (or IP address) -p (port number)
```
- Run a single command remotely
```bash
  ssh user@192.168.1.10 "ls -l /home/user"
```
- Use identity (private key) for login
```bash
  ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa raj@192.168.1.10
```
