## DASH `-`
In **Linux/Unix**, the **dash** `-` is reserved to mean “**an option**” when passed to commands.
so
: 
```bash
  command --
```
Many commands accept `--` to **stop parsing options**.

- But in our case `cat` command not stoping parsing while using command `cat -- -`
**Solution to Solve**
- Using absolute path
: 
```bash
  cat /full/path/to/-
```

## How to Create Hidden File/Folder
We need to place `.` in front of file name. <br>
ex: .hide, .file.txt, .hiddenfolder

Creating a File By Using command line Editor `nano`
: 
```bash
  nano .filename
```
prees `ctrl+s` for save and press `ctrl+x` for exit editor

Creating a Directory By using `mkdir` command
: 
```bash
  mkdir .hiddendirectory
```

## How To Find Hidden Files/Folders
```bash
  ls -a
```
- show all files and folders in working directory including hidden files/folders


## How to read Hidden Files
We can read Directly Name
```bash
cat .hiddenfile
```

- Also use simply way `cd` to go hidden folder. 

## Symbolic Link or Symlink
A file that stores the path to another file.

```bash
ln -s /var/log/syslog mylog
```
- `mylog` → symbolic link
- points to → `/var/log/syslog`

- Viewing Symlinks
: 
```bash
ls -l
```
output:
```bash
lrwxrwxrwx 1 user user     11 Aug 27 21:00 mylog -> /var/log/syslog
```

- check symlink itself and symlink real file File Type
: 
```bash
file mylog
```
```bash
file -L mylog
```


## File descriptors (stdin, stdout, stderr) & `2>/dev/null`

In Linux, every process has file descriptors: 
- 0 → Standard Input (stdin)
- 1 → Standard Output (stdout)
- 2 → Standard Error (stderr)

So when you **run a command**:
- Normal output goes to **stdout** (1)
- Errors go to **stderr** (2)

✅ What `2>/dev/null` does: 
- `2>` → **Redirect stderr** (error messages)
- `/dev/null` → **A special file that discards all data written to it** (like a “**black hole**”)
```bash
command 2>/dev/null
```
- Runs the command, but **hides all error messages**.Normal output (`stdout`) still appears.

**Useful Cases**
: 

1. Suppress unwanted errors (e.g., permission denied, file not found)
: 
```bash
find / -name "file.txt" 2>/dev/null
```
- Finds file without showing "Permission denied" messages.

1. Separate stdout and stderr
: 
```bash
command >out.txt 2>err.txt
```
- Normal output in `out.txt`, errors in `err.txt`.

1. Discard both stdout and stderr
: 
```bash
command > /dev/null 2>&1
```
- Runs silently (no output, no errors).
