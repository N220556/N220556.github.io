## sort Command in Linux

The `sort` command is used to **arrange lines of text in a file or output** in a particular order(alphabetical, numerical, reverse, etc.).

## Syntax
```bash 
sort [options] [file...]
```
If no file is given, `sort` reads from **stdin**.

## Examples

1. Alphabetical Sort
: 
```bash
sort file.txt  # ascending alphabetical order
```

1. Reverse Order
: 
```bash
sort -r file.txtdescending order    # descending order
```

1. Numeric Sort
: 
```bash
sort -n numbers.txt
```
ðŸ‘‰ Sorts numbers (instead of treating them as strings).

1. Human-Readable Numbers (e.g., KB, MB)
: 
```bash
ls -lh | sort -h -k 5
```
ðŸ‘‰ Sorts by file size (human-readable).

1. Sort by Specific Column
: 
```bash
sort -k 2 file.txt
```
ðŸ‘‰ Sorts by the 2nd column of text.

1. Unique Sort (Remove Duplicates)
: 
```bash
sort -u file.txt
```
ðŸ‘‰ Removes duplicate lines while sorting.

1. Case-Insensitive Sort
: 
```bash
sort -f file.txt
```
ðŸ‘‰ Ignores case while sorting (`A` and `a` treated the same).

1. Check if File is Already Sorted
: 
```bash
sort -c file.txt
```
ðŸ‘‰ Tells whether the file is sorted or not.

âœ… Example with multiple options
: 
```bash
sort -k 3 -n -r data.txt
```
ðŸ‘‰ Sort by 3rd column, numeric, reverse order.
