## 🎮 Level 0

### 🎯 Level Goal 
👉The goal of this level is for you to **log into the game using SSH**. The host to which you need to connect is **bandit.labs.overthewire.org**, on **port 2220***. The **username** is **bandit0** and the **password** is **bandit0**. Once logged in, go to the Level 1 page to find out how to beat Level 1.

### 💡 Points to Learn
  - **SSH connections**

👉 [**SSH Connections**](/posts/Nssh) 👈

### 🛠️ Step By Approach To Solve Level

- In our goal they given login into **bandit.labs.overthewire.org** on **port 2220**
- username: **bandit0**
- password: **bandit0**
- SSH login
```bash
  ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

## 🎮 Level 0 → Level 1

### 🎯 Level Goal
👉The password for the next level is **stored in a file** called readme **located in the home directory**. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.

- [**How to Read File content**](/posts/Lcat)




### 🛠️ Step By Approach To Solve Level

#### Step 1 : Logging using SSH
- In our goal they given login into **bandit.labs.overthewire.org** on **port 2220**
- username: bandit0
- password: bandit0
- SSH login
```bash
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

#### Step 2 : Listouting the Files in System
- Reading content in the directory we use **ls** command
```bash
ls
```
- output
: ![Lists readme file](/posts/OTWbandit/OTWBl0ls.png)

#### Step 3 : Listouting content in the File
- Reading content in the File we use **cat** or **tac** ..etc commands 
```bash
cat readme
```
- output
: ![Having next Level Password](/posts/OTWbandit/OTWBl0cat.png)

## 🎮 Level 1 → Level 2 

### 🎯 Level Goal
The password for the next level is **stored in a file** called `-` located in the **home directory**

### 💡 Points to Learn
👉In **Linux/Unix**, the **dash** `-` is reserved to mean “**an option**” when passed to commands.
so
: 
```bash
  command --
```
Many commands accept `--` to stop parsing options.

- But in our case `cat` command not stoping parsing while using command `cat -- -`
**Solution to Solve**
- Using absolute path
: 
```bash
  cat /full/path/to/-
```


### 🛠️ Step By Approach To Solve Level

#### Approach 1
Given that File is Located in **home directory** So,
```bash 
  cat ~/.
```
- `~` : Indicates home directory


#### Approach 2

By default we login into home directory or Navigate to home direcory
: 
```bash
  cd ~
```
- Reading working directory file but we cant't read `-` name file directly
: 
```bash
  cat ./-
```
- `.` : Indicates working directory
- command `cat ./-` states that **read working directory file named `-`**

## 🎮 Level 2 → Level 3

### 🎯 Level Goal
👉The password for the next level is stored in a file called **--spaces in this filename--** located in the **home directory**

### 💡 Points to Learn
- **How To read File Which contains Spaces in their Name**

#### How To read File Which contains Spaces in their Name
we use **quotes** `""` to read file which contains spaces in their name or Navigate the Folder which contains spaces in their name
example
: 
```bash
  cat "spaces named file"
```
```bash
  cd "spaces named folder"
```


### 🛠️ Step By Approach To Solve Level
Here file also containg `-` in the begining of file name so we go through by Folder
```bash
  cat "~/--spaces in the filename--"
```

## 🎮 Level 3 → Level 4

### 🎯 Level Goal
👉 The password for the next level is stored in a **hidden file** in the **inhere** directory.

### 💡 Points to Learn
- **How to Create Hidden File/Folder**
- **How to Navigate**
- **How to Hidden Files**

#### How to Create Hidden File/Folder
We need to place `.` in front of file name. <br>
ex: .hide, .file.txt, .hiddenfolder

Creating a File By Using command line Editor `nano`
: 
```bash
  nano .filename
```
prees `ctrl+s` for save and press `ctrl+x` for exit editor

Creating a Directory By using `mkdir` command
: 
```bash
  mkdir .hiddendirectory
```

#### How To Find Hidden Files/Folders
```bash
  ls -a
```
- show all files and folders in working directory including hidden files/folders


#### **How to read Hidden Files**
We can read Directly Name
```bash
cat .hiddenfile
```

- Also use simply way `cd` to go hidden folder. 

### 🛠️ Step By Approach To Solve Level

#### Step 1: Go to **inhere** directory

```bash
  cd inhere
```
> Don't go blindly always use `ls` is it located or not
{: .prompt-tip }

#### Step 2: Find the Hidden File
```bash
  ls -la
```
![output of ls -la](/posts/OTWbandit/OTWBl3ls.png)

#### Step 3: Read the File Content
```bash
  cat ...Hiding-From-You
```

## 🎮 Level 4 → Level 5

### 🎯 Level Goal
👉The password for the next level is stored in the only **human-readable file** in the **inhere** directory.<br>
**Tip**: if your terminal is messed up, try the “**reset**” command.

### 💡 Points to Learn
- [**`file` command**](/posts/Lfile)
- [**Symbolic Link**](/posts/Ltheory)


### 🛠️ Step By Approach To Solve Level
Given that password located in `inhere` directory and `human-readable file`

#### Step 1: Navigate inhere Directory And Read Directory Content
- Navigate into `inhere` directory
: 
```bash
  cd inhere
```

- Reading Directory Content
: 
```bash
  ls
```
![inhere directory content](/posts/OTWbandit/OTWBl4ls.png)

#### Step 2: Check File Type of all Files and Read Readable File Content
- Checking File type of all Files(with MIME type)
: 
```bash
  file -i ./-file0*
```
![File Type of Files](/posts/OTWbandit/OTWBl4file.png){: .normal}

- Reading `-file07` type: text/plain which is `human-readable file`
: 
```bash
  cat ./-file07
```

- **human-readable**
- **1033 bytes in size**
- **not executable**

### 💡 Points to Learn
- [**find command**](/posts/Lfind)
- [**File descriptors**](/posts/Ltheory)




### 🛠️ Step By Approach To Solve Level
Given data
- **human-readable**
- **1033 bytes in size**
- **not executable**

#### Finding File with given data by Learned things

```bash
find ./inhere -type f -size 1033c ! -executable -exec cat {} \; 2>/dev/null

- owned by user **bandit7**
- owned by group **bandit6**
- **33 bytes** in size

### 💡 Points to Learn

#### CHECK once Again about Find command.
👉[**find** command](/posts/Lfind)

- It is their
#### Step 2: Finding Password
```bash
cat data.txt | sort | uniq -u 
```
- `cat` reads `data.txt` sends **stdout** as **stdin** to `sort`
- `sort` it arrange alphabetical order send **stdout** as **stdin** to `uniq`
- `uniq -u` it check adjacent dupilicates and `-u` returns line that occurs exactly once in **data** as **stdout**.
