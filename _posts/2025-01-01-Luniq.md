# **uniq** command

ðŸ‘‰The **uniq** command in Linux is used to **filter out adjacent duplicate lines** from a **file** or **standard input**.
- It only works on **sorted input** (or grouped duplicates) because it **compares only consecutive lines**.
- Commonly used with **sort** to make **duplicates adjacent**.

## Why is it used?
- To **remove** duplicate lines.
- To **count** how many times a line appears.
- To **display only duplicate** lines.
- To **display only unique** (non-duplicate) lines.

## Syntax

```bash
uniq [OPTION] [INPUT [OUTPUT]]
```
- **INPUT** â†’ file to read from (default: stdin).
- **OUTPUT** â†’ file to write to (default: stdout).

## Main Options & Use Cases of `uniq`

1. Remove duplicates (default behavior)
: 
```bash
uniq file.txt  # Removes adjacent duplicate lines from file.txt
```

1. Show count of occurrences â†’ `-c`
: 
```bash
uniq -c file.txt  # Prepends each line with its count.
```

1. Show only duplicate lines â†’ `-d`
: 
```bash
uniq -d file.txt  # Displays only lines that are repeated.
```

1. Show only unique lines (non-duplicates) â†’ `-u`
: 
```bash
uniq -u file.txt   # Displays lines that occur exactly once.
```

1. Ignore case â†’ `-i`
: 
```bash
uniq -i file.txt  # Treats uppercase and lowercase as the same.
```

1. Skip fields â†’ `-f N`
: 
```bash
uniq -f 1 file.txt  # Ignores the first N fields when comparing.
```

1. Skip characters â†’ `-s N`
: 
```bash
uniq -s 2 file.txt  # Ignores the first N characters when comparing.
```
ðŸ‘‰example:
```text
AAcat
BBcat
CCdog
```
- With `-s 2`, only "cat", "dog" part is compared â†’ duplicate "cat" removed.

1. Limit comparison to N characters â†’ `-w N`
: 
```bash
uniq -w 3 file.txt  # Compares only the first N characters.
```
- With `-w 3`, only first 3 chars are compared â†’ "cat123" and "cat456" are duplicates.

1. Read from stdin & write to stdout
: 
```bash
sort file.txt | uniq
```
- Ensures all duplicates are adjacent before filtering.
- Best practice: always use `sort` with `uniq`.

1. Write output to another file
: 
```bash
uniq input.txt output.txt  # Saves result in output.txt.
```

âš¡ Example combo
: 
```bash
sort file.txt | uniq -ci
```
- **Sorts** input, **Ignores case**, Prints **counts**.
